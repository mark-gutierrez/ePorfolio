                        Hello, I am Mark Gutierrez; an outcome-driven data
                        engineering student with a passion for problem solving,
                        software development and teamwork. I have had the
                        privilege of working in diverse and dynamic teams both
                        in an academic and professional engineering environment
                        where I hone and utilize my passions to benefit my team,
                        the project, and the company. I aim to continue to focus
                        my efforts in improving my skills to deliver the best
                        outcomes in future engineering projects.

                    <p>
                        Design thinking, team management, and peer review are
                        skills that I learned from the studio subjects that I
                        intend to apply to my future engineering work. The six
                        engineering studio subjects allowed me to work in teams
                        comprised of various engineering backgrounds, using our
                        different expertise to reach common goals and complete a
                        project. These subjects helped me be prepared for
                        professional engineering projects in the field that
                        involve many engineering disciplines by improving my
                        teamwork skills. This is made possible by focusing on my
                        specialty and being able to convey my knowledge and
                        technical skills to benefit other engineers' work and
                        overall lead to a successful project.

                    <p>
                        In these studios, we work to create real world products.
                        This involves assessing the competitive landscape of
                        which industry the product resides in and acknowledging
                        the impacts it may have on stakeholders, economically,
                        socially, and environmentally. Research is heavily
                        involved in determining current flaws of products in the
                        market and problems solving skills are used to find
                        solutions to fix or improve the product.

                        will use in my future engineering work to adhere to
                        business goals. At university I effectively performed
                        database designs to a high standard. This enabled me to
                        achieve a perfect high distinction mark (100/100) for my
                        analysis of business goals and application of efficient
                        database designs.

                    <h3>Income Energy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Income Energy is an Invesment consultation company that
                        incentivizes commercial property owners to invest in
                        solar while profiting from tenants&comma; energy
                        savings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whilst working at Income Energy I designed and developed
                        a web-based data miner to collect information on
                        commercial properties in NSW providing potential
                        customer leads for the company. I also led a project
                        development team of 4 in designing and creating a
                        company website to increase our online presence while
                        improving our company outlook. Finally, I deployed a web
                        application that calculates and creates an investment
                        proposal showing potential monthly returns for
                        customers, using their consumption data.

                    <p>Project Achievements</p>
                    <p>
                        Met all deadlines and landed the company our first
                        customer sale. The web application impressed investors
                        during a pitch at Angel Investors and allowed the
                        company to acquire 7 investors and receive our first
                        capital. Created software documentation for future
                        maintenance of all company software.

                    <h3>CashD</h3>
                    <p>
                        CashD provides an app that allows employees to get paid
                        anytime directly to their bank account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time at CashD I implemented two factor
                        authentication on the web app to increase security
                        measures adhering and completing requests from investors
                        and consumers. I also planned and proposed refactoring
                        of code base to comply with OpenAPI 3.0 standards
                        resulting in improved company outreach and consumer
                        adoption. Finally, I liaised with the business team to
                        design and implement a web form workflow that would be
                        used to increase users and online traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p>Project Achievements</p>
                    <p>
                        Met all deadlines and investors were happy that the
                        platform was more secure as it involved customers
                        sensitive data. Documentation and designs for code
                        refactoring was approved by senior engineer and is
                        passed onto another developer to follow. As evident from
                        the business team&comma;s comments, the web form work
                        flowed increased overall user traffic by 15%.

                <section>
                    <p>
                        While working at Income Energy I had many
                        responsibilities, and I was placed in a position of
                        leadership and was required to lead and manage a team of
                        4 to complete various projects. Leading a team had
                        various difficulties such as teaching, delegating tasks,
                        managing egos, and providing constructive
                        reviews/feedback. In the storming phase of the team, I
                        had to identify everyone's strengths and weaknesses and
                        as a leader I was able to utilize and improve
                        everyone&comma;s strengths to complete the projects
                        while addressing their weaknesses to create a synergized
                        team. At times when there were arguments about work
                        distribution/responsibilities, I had to intervene and
                        use my workplace dispute resolution skills to resolve
                        issues. During my time at Income Energy, I took on more
                        responsibilities than my peers by directly communicating
                        with investors as due diligence, updating them on the
                        overall progress of the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With these experiences I am equipped with leadership
                        skills that I will apply in future engineering projects.

                        Many subjects at UTS (University of Technology Sydney)
                        give opportunities for collaboration and teamwork.
                        Effective collaboration skills allowed me to achieve
                        consistent high distinction in team-based Engineering
                        Studios. Each studio I was able to work with a new
                        diverse group of future engineers from different
                        engineering disciplines and experiences. I was able to
                        help team members utilize their strengths to work
                        towards a common goal and lead to a successful, complete
